# Claude Code Hooks Collection - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
A comprehensive collection of Claude Code hooks implemented in Python using the `uv` package manager. This project provides ready-to-use hooks for common development workflows, code quality enforcement, security controls, and custom automation tasks. The hooks leverage Claude Code's lifecycle events to provide deterministic control over AI-assisted development workflows.

**Problem it solves**: Developers need reliable, automated ways to enforce code standards, security policies, and workflow automation during AI-assisted development sessions without relying on LLM suggestions.

**Target users**: Software developers using Claude Code who want to automate development workflows, enforce coding standards, and implement custom business logic during AI interactions.

**Value proposition**: Transform manual development practices into automated, deterministic hooks that execute consistently during Claude Code sessions.

## Core Features

### 1. Code Quality Hooks
- **Auto-formatting**: Automatically format code files after edits using language-specific formatters (prettier, black, gofmt, rustfmt)
- **Linting integration**: Run linters on modified files and provide feedback to Claude
- **Style enforcement**: Validate code against project-specific style guidelines
- **Import organization**: Automatically organize and sort imports after file modifications

### 2. Security & Compliance Hooks
- **File protection**: Block modifications to sensitive files (.env, package-lock.json, production configs)
- **Secret detection**: Scan for potential secrets in code before allowing commits
- **Permission validation**: Ensure Claude has appropriate permissions for requested operations
- **Audit logging**: Comprehensive logging of all tool usage for compliance tracking

### 3. Development Workflow Hooks
- **Git integration**: Auto-stage formatted files, validate commit messages, run pre-commit checks
- **Testing automation**: Run relevant tests after code changes and report results to Claude
- **Build validation**: Ensure builds pass after significant changes
- **Documentation updates**: Auto-generate or update documentation when APIs change

### 4. Notification & Monitoring Hooks
- **Desktop notifications**: Custom notifications for different Claude Code events
- **Slack/Discord integration**: Send workflow updates to team channels
- **Metrics collection**: Track usage patterns and development velocity
- **Error alerting**: Notify about failed operations or security violations

### 5. Custom Business Logic Hooks
- **Project-specific validation**: Enforce company-specific coding standards and practices
- **External system integration**: Sync with project management tools, ticketing systems
- **Environment management**: Auto-switch environments based on file paths or operations
- **Resource monitoring**: Track and limit resource usage during AI sessions

## Technical Architecture

    hook_event_name: str
    
# Tool-specific data
@dataclass  
class ToolUseEvent(HookEvent):
    tool_name: str
    tool_input: Dict[str, Any]
    tool_response: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
```
